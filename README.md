# Smart Social Sims Prototype

A simple web-based social simulation game inspired by social sims. Agents move on a grid, interact, and update moods/energy.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo or create the file structure locally.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome).
3. The simulation runs automatically for 10 turns, updating the canvas.

## Features
- 10x10 grid world with locations (Home, Park, Cafe as tile types).
- 3 agents with moods (happy/neutral/sad), energy, and interactions.
- Basic pathfinding for movement.
- Console logs for details; canvas for visuals.

## Extending
- Add more agents in `agent.js`.
- Improve pathfinding in `pathfinding.js`.
- Replace placeholder images in `/assets`.

Built with vanilla JS. No dependencies required.
